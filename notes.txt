  crazy bash project #33701 ;)
  
  - file name tracker
  - uses git to remember history:
      commit where inode is first added counts as the original file name and gets a tag:
        - lol
        - number of tags 2*no.of.files
        - if tag: inode-orig doesn't exist then file first reference to file and create tag + warn user
        - used to recover orig filename
  - uses inode to track files (limited to single-filesys)
  -
